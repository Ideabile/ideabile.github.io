But personally I'm feeling I'm going in the right direction, and so on I'm exited to say the issue *#1 *of my Project <a href="https://github.com/M3kH/mangiafuoco">MangiaFuoco</a> is officially close: <a href="https://github.com/M3kH/mangiafuoco/issues/1">https://github.com/M3kH/mangiafuoco/issues/1</a> <b>Are you still curious about MangiaFuoco = MF? *MF is a *JavaScript</b> tool for build <b>Compossible Web Applications</b>. MF try to force you to define a Folder Structure for get a Modular loader in a declarative way. </p> <p> This step is really important when you want start a project which can scale without creating a Reference Jungle. </p> <div id="outline-container-mf-encourage-web-components-methodology" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="mf-encourage-web-components-methodology"><b>MF encourage Web Components Methodology</b></h2> <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mf-encourage-web-components-methodology"> <blockquote> <p> <i>Web Component for MF are just Distribute Logic.</i> </p> </blockquote> <p> The only difference is they try to look into a folder structure instead of just a file, so they would use module<sub>name</sub> as directory and look for a index.js inside it. </p> <p> Different of what <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> Web Components are, <i><b>MF Components are think to required an app context</b></i> which would make sure that Flavoured Framework Component can access to his own requirement like app.Backbone or app.Marionette or app.Angular. </p> <p> In this way Components folder can be moved across projects augmenting the granularity of the applications and helping you to create a better reusable code/logics. </p> </div> </div> <div id="outline-container-extend-projects" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="extend-projects"><b>Extend Projects</b></h2> <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-extend-projects"> <p> Additional to Web Components blueprints, MF give you the possibility to extend your app project with another app project. </p> <p> This functionality is not recursive but make you easy to reuse full projects code. </p> <p> MF with Extend Project functionality intend to means if the file is not in ProjectB then I will look for it in ProjectA; </p> <p> In this way you can create giants app and extend it with just one file in a 'empty' project. </p> </div> </div> <div id="outline-container-framework-free-but-not-dependency-free" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="framework-free-but-not-dependency-free"><b>Framework Free but not Dependency Free</b></h2> <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-framework-free-but-not-dependency-free"> <p> MF require Underscore and an AMD environment (Node.js, RequireJS or Browserify), has only dependency. But is framework free and so you can think has a wrap for declare you global 'app'. </p> <p> Think to declare global all your dependencies with mf.global({$: jQuery}); </p> <p> and use like this: MF.; </p> <p> Additional to this MF provide you Adapters, which basically means you can extend MF for integrate with you flavour FrameWork. </p> </div> <div id="outline-container-is-good-practice-declare-it-has-a-app" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="is-good-practice-declare-it-has-a-app"><b>Is good practice declare it has a 'app'</b></h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-is-good-practice-declare-it-has-a-app"> <p> MF try to simplify the usage of the AMD, delivering you the ability to declare an instance of in in your own way, although MF try to represent the app end point concept, and so on is good practice in example declare it has , but still you are not forced too. </p> </div> </div> <div id="outline-container-why-i-should-use-it" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="why-i-should-use-it"><b>Why I should use it?</b></h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-i-should-use-it"> <ul class="org-ul"> <li>You want keep organise your folder system of the your front-end part, you want create more reusable code, you want a easy way to scale your project.</li> <li>You work in Multi Page Web Projects.
