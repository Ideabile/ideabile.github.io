The comments told_ /about Committers in JavaScript Standards, and they said are composted just by /IT Leaders Companies; /&#x2026; after that, I started to looking for the Author of JS: /<a href="https://brendaneich.com/">Brendan Eich</a>_ How you can see he is not a Graphic Designer, but I think the web page is better then others <i>Programming Language Authors</i> ( I would like to save the <i>top five</i> for another post ). Brendan also has an own Word Press installation with his customizations. Actually my attention is not about the design of the page, but the absent of JavaScript! So please Brendan, if you are fan like we are for JS, please promoting it with using in your page too. I'm joking, maybe he could be too busy to do it, but actually I'm still surprise.
