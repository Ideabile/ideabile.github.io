To allow us to play without thinking to hardware requirements. </p> <p> Not only that, Cloud Computing can offer a new key change to the market of video games, and change radically their business models; and convert them as a service models, same that happen to the software. </p> <p> From the beginning to the <i>'Insert Coin'</i> to the era of <i>'free to play'</i> the market can change again. And probably Game Publishers should consider to sell package Game + Cloud Computing + Streaming = Pay and Play where you want. So a bit like coming back to the retro Games Rooms. </p> <p> <i>'Pay for Play'</i>. In the beginning I didn't understand why Chromebook was there in the market, looks a bit unrealistic. And more recently the new Mac Book come's in, which has sort of the same vision. But in a era where Cloud can handle the hardware requirements and transfer the complex rendering calculation, and send them has rendered stream, through internet. The device like RaspBerry PI (5) can become a full console, whit-out having any hw requirements. I was thinking careful before buying any kind of console, or computer, just to satisfy my 2/3 hours weekly of gaming. Yes I'm not really a gamer. </p> <p> Honestly I don't like to pay up in front for something I would rarely use, so Hardware would be pointless because I spent most of the time in my computer and I don't need another one. Unfortunately long time ago I decide to invest my all hard gained budget in a Mac Book Pro. And even if it cost me so much I couldn't play any recent game with it. </p> <p> Since didn't have a proper video card. So I spend some research if was possible to craft or buy an external Graphic Video Card, and come's out that was few people did it. </p> <p> But still you have to buy some Video card, some Power Adapters and Power Supply Units and some Port adapters to be able to connect to the Thunderbolt Port. </p> <p> Everything ends up around _250/Users/m/work/ideabile/www/content/articles/../../tangled/convert-md-to-org.js which is less or more half then a console but still a consistent budget for a solution which I wasn't enthusiastic to invest since you can't run native in Mac OS. </p> <p> Then Larry Land come's out with an Article (<a href="http://lg.io/2015/04/12/run-your-own-high-end-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html">Run your own high-end cloud gaming service on EC2</a>) where he show and explain how to run the Steam In-House Streaming technology on Amazon EC2 instances, I decided to give it a try and to see if this experiments was worth it the money. The result is the video that you find in the begin (at the top). </p> <div id="orgd55b697" class="figure"> <p><img src="http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram_t.jpg" alt="InHomeStreamingDiagram_t.jpg"> </p> <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Steam InHome Streaming</p> </div> <p> <i>Steam In-Home streaming diagram technology.</i> I could setup and play with my cloud console for less then 2€, and pay the game for 19.99€ (Assassin Creed IV). So a total game + hw of 21€. My lucky is that Amazon Recently open a new Data Center at Frankfurt, and that allow me to have a good ping response time for the gaming experience.
