Fabrizio Gatti was undercover when he experienced the Lampedusa culture. But this treatment wasn't reserve just to him. I was ten years old when in the restaurant of my parents came a friend of us to ask help for some just arrived tunisian people. Some of them where in bad conditions and some of them were already died. Ten minutes after Lampedusa's people formed different groups for different tasks: food, clothes, preparing locations, rescuing and burying the bodies. There wasn't a country, there was just Lampedusa's people. I don't know if Lampedusa needs a Nobel Prize, but I know that Lampedusa is a symbol for everybody. </p> <p> <a href="http://temi.repubblica.it/espresso-appelli/nobel-to-lampedusa-sign-your-nomination/">Nobel to Lampedusa, sign your nomination</a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> Copyright Â© 2000/2022 Mauro Mandracchia<br> Verbatim copying and redistribution of this entire page are permitted provided this notice is preserved.<br> Verbatim copying and redistribution of any of the photos is permitted under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons Noderivs Nocommercial license version 3.0</a> or later. </footer> </div> </body></html>
