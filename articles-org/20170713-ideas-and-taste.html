I get exited when I'm discussing something. Especially when is something
that I <i>truly believe</i>.
</p> <p>
It can happen that while I'm confronting my self to an Idea, I will be
sceptical about it. When I start to think at it, even if is my own one,
I question it.
</p> <p>
Not sure if these question are valid for any kind of topics, but to get
an idea: &gt; * What are the trades? Gains vs Pays? Why is worth it? &gt; *
Did someone else has experience with it? What does it say? ~ Googlit! &gt;

<div id="outline-container-org1bdb283" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1bdb283">What are the requirements? What does cost maintaining?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1bdb283">
<p>
But that doesn't mean I'm against. Instead I'm looking to convince my
self to it. Actually if I start questioning would be that somehow I
already bought the idea and I'm starting considering.
</p> <p>
I start this post with a quote from Confucius because I was inspired by
my latest discussion that I've with some other coders.
</p> <p>
Now you might now that I'm a JavaScript lover and try to get most of my
skill and diets. I went from that fork before and I've my investigations
ready. It took me a while since I was a semicolons supporter to get into
the diet of avoid them.
</p> <p>
Today has been an Year that I did that decision and all my pet projects
reflect that choices. I'm proud of it.
</p> <p>
Doesn't really matter is a good decision that I made or not. When the
time pass by I would re-valuate it. The only thing that I care is the
approach in how I get there and what arguments power that choice.
</p> <blockquote>
<p>
<i>Semicolons in JavaScript are optional and in some cases not needed at
all.</i> <i>Questioning if is needed put them or not while coding is just
loosing time.</i> <i>Plus modern transpiler add semicolons for you.</i>
</p>
</blockquote> <p>
That was enough to buy me, the braid is basically pay to the fact that
now days I always transpile my code. Is quiet a lot of config but indeed
is not just a bunch of less-semicolons what I'm gaining.
</p> <p>
Coming back to the quote, I like semicolons in the past, I'm happy I
leave them behind. I was the imbecile that look to the finger and the
wise that look to the moon at the same time.
</p> <p>
Especially in these small details is hard to say if what your thoughts
are driven by ideology or if there is an scientific-alike approach.
Investigate the limits of a thought especially if you've an opinion is
hard.
</p> <p>
The only thing that I hope isn't being the <i>imbecile</i> that looks to the
details; but rather the <i>wise man</i> that look to the <i>wide picture</i>.
</p> <p>
So to the approach of yesterday after having a discussion that almost
end up in taste arguments, I try to prove to me that the way I write
code today is better than what it was yesterday.
</p> <p>
I end up doing this: <i>10 line sugar</i> See the Pen bgDisco by Mauro
Mandracchia (@M3kH) on CodePen.
